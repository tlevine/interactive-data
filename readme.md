that I'm [giving a talk](https://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/64128_10151604466650452_924988096_n.jpg) ([mirror](poster.jpg)).
So here are some slides.

## Outline
I account for 17 minutes so far.

* OMG Data (2 minutes)
* Is this interactive? 
  * For each of some examples, raise your hand for yes, no, or stupid question (3 minutes, that is, 40 seconds each)
  * For each of the same examples, ask people why they thought so. (8 minutes, that is, 2 minutes each)
* Flashy pseudo interactivity (1 minute)
  * Show a few examples
* I think interactivity is about finding your own stories. (2 minutes, that is, 40 seconds each)
  * News apps
  * Static images that do this
  * ...
* Conslusionary slide with the main points (1 minute)

## How to
Edit the slides by editing `slides.md`. Vertically-separated slides are
separated by three line breaks, and horizontally-separated slides are separated
by four line breaks.
