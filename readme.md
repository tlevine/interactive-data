that I'm [giving a talk](https://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/64128_10151604466650452_924988096_n.jpg) ([mirror](poster.jpg)).
So here are some slides.

## Outline
I account for 20 minutes, but will probably be more like 16 minutes. *Use a timer while giving the presentation.*

* OMG Data (2 minutes)
* Is this interactive?
  * Introduce (0.5 minutes)
  * For each of some examples, raise your hand for yes, no, or stupid question (3 minutes, that is, 40 seconds each)
  * For each of the same examples, ask people why they thought so. (8 minutes, that is, 2 minutes each, with 40 seconds per answer)
    * Ask one person for yes, one person for no and one person for neither
* Flashy pseudo interactivity (1.5 minutes)
  * Show a few examples
* I think interactivity is about finding your own stories. (3 minutes, that is, 1 minute each)
  * News apps
  * Static images that do this
  * ...
* Conslusionary slide with the main points (1 minute)

## How to
Edit the slides by editing `slides.md`. Vertically-separated slides are
separated by three line breaks, and horizontally-separated slides are separated
by four line breaks.
