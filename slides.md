How can we tame the data rather than fighting them?


## "Interactives"
"Interactives" can apparently help us make sense of data.




# Is this interactive?
<!-- For each of some examples, ask the question and have people raise hands. -->
Answer with

* Yes
* No
* Stupid question, unsure, abstain, &c.

# Summarizing Tom's theory about the word "interactivity"
* When people seek "interactivity", they want to create or find their own stories.
* Flashy things with movement give people an illusion of personalized story-telling.
* Under this definition, static text or image can be interactive.
